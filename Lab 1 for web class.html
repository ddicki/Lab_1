		<p>I graduated from Ohio University a long time ago.  I have been happily married to my best friend De for 9 yrs. 
		I have been working at NASA for the last 30 years in 
		their Propulsion Systems Lab.  We test a variety of engines including Ram Jet, Scram Jet and conventional gas turbine
		engines for both commercial and military applications.
		</p>
		
		<p>For the last few years our facility has concentrated on testing engine icing issues since this a a growing problem 
		and ours is the only facility in the world that can test a jet engine under icing conditions at altitude.
